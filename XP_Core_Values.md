# Extreme Programming (XP) Core Values


## Communication
One of our team's greatest assets was its ability to communicate. Despite the fact that we could not meet in person often, our team held scrum meetings every week on Wednesday and Saturday.
We discussed our progress and dealt with dependence concerns and other roadblocks during the call.
To keep track of our user stories and manage the project, we used KANBAN. This allowed us to track the progress of several tasks during the sprint.
We chose to take on responsibilities based on our unique strengths and to aid each other by interacting on a regular basis through Zoom meetings. Any problems or issues were routinely discussed during the meetings.

## Simplicity
We used a critical perspective to determine the most important aspects of the project scope, and only executed what was required.
As we introduced new APIs and matching UI components, actively striving to eliminate duplications helped us maintain our code easily.
We made sure the names of all classes, methods, and variables were explicit and conveyed the intent clearly.

## Feedback
During the early development and testing phase, everyone's feedback was crucial. We made it a point to pay attention to everyone's suggestions without interrupting them.
We had a 15-minute feedback session just prior to the conclusion of every meeting to check on what went according to plan and what needed to be fixed in the future.
We tested features developed by other team members and provided comments during the testing process. It helped us identify and resolve the bugs.
We were able to identify roadblocks, improve, and perform better due to the feedbacks we received.

## Respect
Everyone was considerate of the time, efforts and views of the other team members. 
During the process of selecting technological stacks, team members acknowledged each other's viewpoints and ideas. 
Everyone politely agreed on the technologies chosen by a majority vote, and committed to study and develop the necessary abilities to put them into practice. 
When a group member experienced an unexpected challenge, all of us were empathetic and polite, and everyone volunteered to make and solve the situation.
